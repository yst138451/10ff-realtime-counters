Results might not be in perfect sync since we're calculating the scores client-side while the end result, server-side; but it's usually only a few CPMs off. It should still be reliable in giving you a quick heads-up on your possible achievement during the test.

## üåü Features
- Realtime WPM counter (for sure).
- Beer-filling-up progress bar.  
    **Note**: Click on the default countdown timer to show/hide it and type on with this!

## Configurations (optional)
Head over to `src` folder and open up the [`config.json`](/src/config.json) file, make your desired changes and reproduce the target script by running `npm start`.

### Default options
```json
{
  "wpmCounter": {
    "styles": {
      "color": "#de1531",
      "fontSize": "1.3em",
      "fontFamily": "Roboto, monospace"
    }
  },
  "progressBar": {
    "fillColor": "rgba(210, 150, 122, 0.2)"
  }
