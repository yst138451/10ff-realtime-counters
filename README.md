# Unofficial realtime WPM counter for 10FF

This is a self-contained script for "injecting" additional functionalities, and all about improved typing experience on 10FF.

# [Bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet)
To create one, do the following:
1. Run `npm start`, then
1. Locate the output file inside the `dist` folder
1. Copy the whole script text to clipboard
1. Fire up your favorite browser of choice (e.g. Chrome) and hit `Ctrl+Shift+B` or `Command+Shift+B` on Mac to display the bookmark bar (if you haven't already)
1. Add a new bookmark, name it and in the URL field, paste the script you copied earlier prefixed with `javascript:` protocol, like so:

```
javascript: (paste_copied_script_here)
```

At this point, go to the 10FF site, click on this bookmark and enjoy! :)
