  },

## ‚ùì How to use
#### [Bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) (recommended for regular use)

To create one, do the following:
1. Run `npm start` (non-programming users can ignore this step), then
1. Locate the output file (called "[**10ff-realtime-counters.min.js**][script-file]") inside the [`dist`](/dist/) folder.
1. Copy the whole script text to clipboard.
1. Fire up your favorite browser of choice (e.g. Chrome) and hit <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+B</kbd> or <kbd>Command+Shift+B</kbd> on Mac to [display the bookmark bar][bookmark] (if you haven't already).
1. Add a new bookmark, name it and in the URL field, paste the script you copied earlier prefixed with `javascript:` protocol, like so:

    ```
    javascript:(paste_the_copied_script_here)
    ```

1. At this point, go to the [10FF site][10ff], click on this bookmark and enjoy! :)
